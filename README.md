# Crystal Exchange Protocol - Secure Asset Transaction Framework

## Overview
The Crystal Exchange Protocol provides a robust framework for secure asset transactions within the blockchain ecosystem. It utilizes Clarity smart contracts to manage digital assets in phased transactions and enforce multi-party validations. The protocol includes mechanisms for asset custody, lifecycle management, dispute resolution, and validation, with strong security and transparency.

## Features
- **Phased Transactions**: Divides large transactions into smaller phases for better security and management.
- **Chamber Management**: Enforces strict lifecycle management for assets held in chambers, including creation, termination, and conflict resolution.
- **Security Mechanisms**: Multiple validation layers, including supervisor and originator checks, prevent unauthorized actions.
- **Conflict Resolution**: A built-in adjudication system allows for equitable distribution of assets in case of disputes.
- **Reference Data Attachment**: Allows authorized parties to attach reference data such as asset details, transfer evidence, and quality verification.

## Components
- **ChamberRegistry**: Stores data on each chamber, including asset details, quantity, and status.
- **Finalization, Prolongation, and Termination Functions**: Ensure secure completion, extension, or cancellation of transactions.
- **Adjudication System**: Provides a mechanism for resolving disputes and ensuring fair asset distribution.
- **Digital Signature Support**: Verifies digital signatures attached to chambers for added security.
- **Contested Chambers**: Marks chambers as contested, enabling conflict resolution.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/crystal-exchange-protocol.git
   cd crystal-exchange-protocol
   ```

2. Deploy the contract on the Stacks blockchain using the Stacks CLI or your preferred deployment tool.

3. Interact with the contract:
   - Use the `create-phased-chamber` function to initiate a new chamber with phased transactions.
   - Use `finalize-chamber-transaction`, `prolong-chamber-lifespan`, and `terminate-chamber` to manage the lifecycle of assets.
   - Adjudicate disputes with `adjudicate-conflict` or initiate chamber conflicts with `initiate-chamber-conflict`.

## Security
The protocol enforces multiple layers of security checks to prevent unauthorized transactions, including:
- Only authorized parties (originator, beneficiary, or supervisor) can interact with the contract.
- Chambers are managed with strict lifecycle controls to ensure assets are only transferred when conditions are met.
